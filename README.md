# MultiPath TCP Implementation in C

This project contains an implementation of the MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) protocol in C. MPTCP is an extension to the standard TCP protocol that allows a single connection to use multiple network paths simultaneously. This improves performance, reliability, and fault tolerance in modern networks that often consist of multiple access technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular) and can switch between them dynamically.

This implementation provides a simple solution with no custom inputs and uses SSN and DSN. It shows the output in the terminal window indicating specific subflow and pipe being used. The program takes two inputs: the desired server address and four port numbers as arguments.
